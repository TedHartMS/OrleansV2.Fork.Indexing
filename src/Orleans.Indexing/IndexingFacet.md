## Overview of Indexing
Indexing enables grains to be efficiently queried by scalar properties. A research paper describing the interface and implementation can be found [here](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p29-bernstein-cidr17.pdf).

Indexing is defined at two levels: at the application level as property attributes on application properties classes, and by implementation classes supplied by Orleans to either update the indexes created from these attributes, or to translate LINQ queries into the retrieval of grains keyed by these indexes.

In this discussion, generic type arguments are prefaced with 'T'. `TProperties` is the type of an application-level class containing properties to be indexed (which are marked with `IndexAttribute` or a subclass). `TIProperties` is the type of an underlying interface for such a class. `TGrainState` is the type of the persistent state of the indexed grain; it must be a class type with an empty constructor, and an instance is created by the IIndexedState implementation as its State property, which functions as the backing store for all of the grain's persistent properties, indexed or not. `TIIndexableGrain` is the type of an interface that has been marked as indexable (details below).

The examples in this discussion use the SportsTeamIndexing sample at Samples\2.1\SportsTeamIndexing. View the readme.md in that directory for instructions on running the sample. The SportsTeamIndexing.Interfaces project defines the grain and properties interfaces (and property classes, because the grain interface definition requires the property class definition), the SportsTeamIndexing.Grains directory defines the Grain (and GrainState) classes, and OrleansClient\ClientProgram.cs creates and queries the indexed grains.

The SportsTeamIndexing sample is intended to be simple, and implements only a single indexed interface on the SportsTeamGrain. More complicated scenarios that implement multiple indexed interfaces on a single grain are also supported. This discussion will also refer to the Indexing Unit Tests for MultipleInterface, which implement three indexed interfaces on TestEmployeeGrain; those interfaces use TProperties classes that implement IPersonProperties, IJobProperties, and IEmployeeProperties. These classes are defined in test\Orleans.Indexing.Tests\Grains\MultiInterface.

Transactional indexes are not yet defined; some references are here as currently best-guess placeholders.
### Features
Indexing is done on a per-interface, per-property basis; details are described below. An interface conceptually provides a namespace for the indexes on each of the properties of the properties-class object associated with that interface. If a grain class has one or more indexed interfaces, then all instances of that class are indexed.
#### Partitioning Options
Indexing is implemented within grains, which use storage providers to persist the index. In a cluster with multiple silos, the question naturally arises as to how the index values are partitioned across the various silos.
##### Entire Index in a Single Grain
The simplest approach is to store the index as a single grain on whatever silo the Orleans activation process assigns it to. As the number of indexed grains grows, this single grain becomes a bottleneck.
##### Partitioned Per Silo
An index may be physically partitioned over Active grains, so grains and their index are on the same silo. This option is available only for Active grains. This allows the silo to function as the unit of failure, since an index and the grains it references fail together, which simplifies recovery.
##### Partitioned Per Key Hash
An index may be partitioned with a bucket for each key's hash value. Thus, one index grain contains entries for all indexed grains, across all silos, whose value for the indexed property hashes to a given value.
#### Other Configuration Options
The following characteristics may be configured for indexes:
##### Eager vs. Lazy Index Updates
The index hash buckets may be updated eagerly (the index updates the hash bucket directly), or lazily (the index enqueues a workflow record to perform the update).
##### Fault Tolerance
When this option is configured, a multi-step workflow is done for index updates, using the same queues that a lazy update uses. The fault-tolerance is provided by storing the list of in-flight index updates as part of the grain state; if the grain crashes, then when it is next activated, the workflows remaining in its state once again commence executing.
##### Active, Total, and Storage-Managed Indexes
An Active index maintains entries for only the grains currently active; when a grain is deactivated, it is removed from the index.

A Total grain maintains entries for all grains that have been activated over the life of the index.

Storage-Managed indexes delegate all indexing to the storage provider and do not maintain any cached index state within Orleans. Currently only CosmosDB has a storage provider that implements the necessary "interface" (a way to specify the indexed properties, and a LookupAsync method that is invoked dynamically).
##### Large Hash Buckets
An index can be configured to have very large hash buckets, to handle highly-skewed distributions of values more efficiently. The default is no limit; the actual number varies depending on the number of indexed grains and the distribution of the hash.

## Application Level
This section describes the indexing interface that is presented to the application developer.
### Application Properties Classes
Applications define the data classes whose properties are indexed, for example:
```c#
    [Serializable]
    public class SportsTeamIndexedProperties : ISportsTeamIndexedProperties
    {
        [Index(typeof(ActiveHashIndexPartitionedPerKey<string, ISportsTeamGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = false)]
        public string Name { get; set; }
        // ...
    }
```
#### Property Attributes
As shown above, an index on a property is defined by placing an attribute on it. While we support placing annotations on multiple properties in a `TProperties` class, each annotation defines a separate index; we currently do not support true compound indexes (they can be simulated by using computed properties such as QualifiedName in the sample). The name of the index is derived from the property name; e.g., the Location property will result in the creation of an index currently named "__Location", under the interface deriving from `IIndexableGrain<TProperties>`. In the sample, the Interface is ISportsTeamGrain, which implements `IIndexableGrain<SportsTeamIndexedProperties>`. Details of the indexable interface are presented below.

##### Index type
The Index attribute may be `Index` or one of the attribute classes inheriting from it; currently these are `ActiveIndex`, `TotalIndex`, or `StorageManagedIndex`.
##### Other Parameters
Index attributes have other parameters for partitioning and other configuration objects as described under [Features](#features).
#### Interaction of Indexed Properties and Grain State
Generally, the `TGrainProperties` class is a base class of `TGrainState`, because the indexing implementation casts `TGrainState` to `TProperties` if possible. If there are multiple `TIIndexableGrain`s with multiple `TProperties`, then direct inheritance is not possible. For any `TProperties` that is not a base of `TGrainState`, the Indexing implementation creates an ephemeral `TProperties` instance and copies `TGrainState`'s property values using direct name matching. (Note that the application Grain does not usually create an instance of `TProperties`; rather, it populates the instance of `TGrainState` created by the `IIndexedState<TGrainState>` implementation.) The properties of `TProperties` are then written to index storage.

The grain state is the backing storage for properties values and will be written to persistent storage; thus, the state class (and not the properties class) must have the [Serializable] attribute. Additionally, because the index specifications are not relevant to the state persistence, the same state class may be used as the backing storage specification for multiple properties classes.

For a single indexed interface, the `TGrainState` class can inherit from the `TProperties` class. For example:
```c#
    public interface ISportsTeamIndexedProperties
    {
        string Name { get; set; }
        string QualifiedName { get; set; }
        string Location { get; set; }
        string League { get; set; }
    }

    public class SportsTeamIndexedProperties : ISportsTeamIndexedProperties
    {
        [Index(typeof(ActiveHashIndexPartitionedPerKey<string, ISportsTeamGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = false)]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Index(typeof(ActiveHashIndexPartitionedPerKey<string, ISportsTeamGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = true)]
        public string QualifiedName { get => JoinName(this.League, this.Name); set => SplitName(value); }

        [ActiveIndex(ActiveIndexType.HashIndexPartitionedByKeyHash, IsEager = true, IsUnique = false)]
        public string Location { get; set; }

        [ActiveIndex(ActiveIndexType.HashIndexPartitionedByKeyHash, IsEager = true)]
        public string League { get; set; }
    }

    [Serializable]
    public class SportsTeamState : SportsTeamIndexedProperties
    {
        // This property is not indexed.
        public string Venue { get; set; }
    }
```

For multiple indexed interfaces, the `TGrainState` class and `TProperties` classes should implement common interfaces, since multiple inheritance is not available. For example:
```c#
    // This code block is a simplification of what is in the MultiInterface Unit Tests.
    public interface IPersonProperties
    {
        string Name { get; set; }
        int Age { get; set; }
    }

    public interface IJobProperties
    {
        string Title { get; set; }
        string Department { get; set; }
    }

    public interface IEmployeeProperties
    {
        int EmployeeId { get; set; }
    }

    public class PersonProperties : IPersonProperties
    {
        [Index(typeof(IActiveHashIndexSingleBucket<string, IPersonGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = true)]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Index(typeof(IActiveHashIndexSingleBucket<int, IPersonGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = false, NullValue = "0")]
        public int Age { get; set; }
    }

    [Serializable]
    public class JobProperties : IJobProperties
    {
        [Index(typeof(IActiveHashIndexSingleBucket<string, IJobGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = true)]
        public string Title { get; set; }

        [Index(typeof(IActiveHashIndexSingleBucket<string, IJobGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = false)]
        public string Department { get; set; }
    }

    [Serializable]
    public class EmployeeProperties : IEmployeeProperties
    {
        [Index(typeof(IActiveHashIndexSingleBucket<int, IEmployeeGrain>), IsEager = true, IsUnique = true, NullValue = "-1")]
        public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
    }
```
##### NullValue for Non-Nullable Property Types
In the foregoing code example, the IndexAttribute specifications for the properties of type int that are unique must have the "NullValue" attribute. This is because, unlike string properties, integers cannot be null, so Indexing will write an index entry for a new grain even when its values have not yet been set or the grain's state saved, which is bad in general and, for unique indexes, will result in erroneous uniqueness violations when more than one such grain is created. Because 0 may be a valid value, the index must specify the value for which the property is to be considered null.

### Application Grain Interfaces
Indexes are grouped by the interface for which they are defined, although the indexes are named for the `TProperties` properties, not any properties defined on the interfaces. Essentially, the interface name functions as a namespace for the group of indexes defined on the `TProperties` of the interface's base `IIndexableGrain<TProperties>` specification.

`TIIndexableGrain`s defined by the application must inherit from [`IIndexableGrain<TProperties>`](#iindexablegrain). Additionally, it should define Task-based properties to set the underlying properties; the properties are Task-based properties because they are implemented on the [Grain implementation class](#application-grain-implementation-classes). For example:
```c#
    public interface ISportsTeamGrain : IGrainWithIntegerKey, IIndexableGrain<SportsTeamIndexedProperties>
    {
        Task<string> GetQualifiedName();
        Task SetQualifiedName(string name);

        Task<string> GetName();
        Task SetName(string name);

        Task<string> GetLocation();
        Task SetLocation(string location);

        Task<string> GetLeague();
        Task SetLeague(string league);

        Task<string> GetVenue();
        Task SetVenue(string venue);
        #endregion not indexed

        Task SaveAsync();
    }
```
In addition to the Task-based property accessors, this interface also defines a method SaveAsync to save the state of the Grain and its indexes.

### Indexing Facet Specification
The grain developer specifies which indexing consistency scheme to use via a Facet: this is done by adding an IIndexedState parameter to an indexed grain's constructor, and decorating it with an attribute that identifies the indexing consistency scheme to use for that grain. The Indexing implementation and the underlying Orleans Facet System create an appropriate subclass of IIndexedState to pass as the actual constructor argument.
#### Attribute Specification
The attribute determines the consistency scheme and storage provider to use for this grain.
##### Indexing Consistency Scheme
The attribute type whether a workflow-based (either fault-tolerant or non-fault-tolerant) or transactional indexing consistency scheme is to be used, and specifies the name of the storage provider
The attribute must also implement the Orleans IFacetMetadata marker interface; this tells the Orleans infrastructure to instantiate the facet implementation. The Orleans-supplied attributes are listed here briefly, and are described in detail in the [Indexing Implementation](#orleans-indexing-implementation-classes) section:
```c#
    public class NonFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedStateAttribute : IndexedStateAttribute, IFacetMetadata, INonFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedStateAttribute, IIndexedStateConfiguration {...}

    public class FaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedStateAttribute : IndexedStateAttribute, IFacetMetadata, IFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedStateAttribute, IIndexedStateConfiguration {...}

    public class TransactionalIndexedStateAttribute : IndexedStateAttribute, IFacetMetadata, IFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedStateAttribute, IIndexedStateConfiguration {...}
```

##### Storage Provider
All of the IndexedStateAttribute subclasses have a constructor of the form:
```c#
        public /* class name */(string storageName = null) => base.StorageName = storageName;
```

Any `[StorageProvider]` attribute on an indexed grain class is ignored. This effectively means that the grain's storage specification is an aspect of the Indexing facet.

##### Example Attribute Specification
Here is an example of IndexedStateAttribute use; the IIndexedState constructor parameter is instantiated by the Orleans Facet infrastructure based upon the Attribute type and is stored in the Grain class for later use. For more information see the [Grain implementation class](#application-grain-implementation-classes) section below.
```c#
    IIndexedState<SportsTeamState> indexedState;

    public SportsTeamGrain(
        [NonFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedState(GrainStoreName)]
        IIndexedState<SportsTeamState> indexedState) => this.indexedState = indexedState;
```
### <a name="application-grain-implementation-classes"></a>Application Grain Implementation Classes
Grain classes that implement a `TIIndexableGrain` must specify an Indexing facet on the constructor, as described elsewhere. This constructor argument is an `IIndexedState<TGrainState>` instance which stores the actual state data (the `TProperties` instance is ephemeral, created only during the process of index writing). For example: 
```c#
    [StorageProvider(ProviderName = SportsTeamGrain.GrainStore)]
    public class SportsTeamGrain : Grain<IndexableGrainStateWrapper<SportsTeamState>>, ISportsTeamGrain, IIndexableGrain<SportsTeamIndexedProperties>
    {
        // This must be configured when setting up the Silo; see SiloHost.cs StartSilo().
        public const string GrainStoreName = "SportsTeamGrainMemoryStore";

        IIndexedState<SportsTeamState> indexedState;

        SportsTeamState TeamState => base.State.UserState;

        public SportsTeamGrain(
            [NonFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedState(GrainStoreName)]
            IIndexedState<SportsTeamState> indexedState) => this.indexedState = indexedState;

        public Task<string> GetName() => Task.FromResult(this.TeamState.Name);
        public Task SetName(string name) => this.SetProperty(() => this.TeamState.Name = name);

        public Task<string> GetQualifiedName() => Task.FromResult(this.TeamState.QualifiedName);
        public Task SetQualifiedName(string name) => this.SetProperty(() => this.TeamState.QualifiedName = name);

        public Task<string> GetLocation() => Task.FromResult(this.TeamState.Location);
        public Task SetLocation(string location) => this.SetProperty(() => this.TeamState.Location = location);

        public Task<string> GetLeague() => Task.FromResult(this.TeamState.League);
        public Task SetLeague(string role) => this.SetProperty(() => this.TeamState.League = role);

        public Task<string> GetVenue() => Task.FromResult(this.TeamState.Venue);
        public Task SetVenue(string venue) => this.SetProperty(() => this.TeamState.Venue = venue);

        public async Task SaveAsync() => await this.indexedState.WriteAsync();

        ...

        #region Facet methods - required overrides of Grain
        public override Task OnActivateAsync() => this.indexedState.OnActivateAsync(this, () => Task.CompletedTask);
        public override Task OnDeactivateAsync() => this.indexedState.OnDeactivateAsync(() => Task.CompletedTask);
        #endregion Facet methods - required overrides of Grain

        #region Required implementations of IIndexableGrain methods; they are only called for fault-tolerant index writing
        public Task<Immutable<System.Collections.Generic.HashSet<Guid>>> GetActiveWorkflowIdsSet() => this.indexedState.GetActiveWorkflowIdsSet();
        public Task RemoveFromActiveWorkflowIds(System.Collections.Generic.HashSet<Guid> removedWorkflowId) => this.indexedState.RemoveFromActiveWorkflowIds(removedWorkflowId);
        #endregion required implementations of IIndexableGrain methods
    }
```
Grain classes may implement multiple `TIIndexableGrain`s. For example:
```c#
    // This code block is a simplification of what is in the MultiInterface Unit Tests.
    public interface IPersonGrain : IIndexableGrain<PersonProperties>, IGrainWithIntegerKey
    {
    }

    public interface IJobGrain : IIndexableGrain<JobProperties>, IGrainWithIntegerKey
    {
    }

    public interface IEmployeeGrain : IIndexableGrain<EmployeeProperties>, IGrainWithIntegerKey
    {
    }

    public class EmployeeGrain<EmployeeGrainState, IndexableGrainStateWrapper<EmployeeGrainState>>,
                                               IPersonGrain, IJobGrain, IEmployeeGrain
    {
        ...
    }
```
#### Indexed Grain Implementation Requirements
Using the SportsTeamGrain example above, there are a few things the grain implementation must do for indexing to work properly.
##### Wrap the `TGrainState`
Indexing stores some information along with the grain state. For non-fault-tolerant indexing, this is done by wrapping `TGrainState` with `IndexableGrainStateWrapper`, whose additional state simply indicates whether the state object has had its non-reference properties initialized to their specified NullValues. If this has not been done, it means the grain was not read from persistent storage, so the `IIndexedState` implementation will assign the NullValues specified for all `TProperties` used by indexable interfaces of that Grain.

Fault-tolerant indexing defines `FaultTolerantIndexableGrainStateWrapper`, a subclass of `IndexableGrainStateWrapper` that also stores the in-flight workflow IDs for that Grain.

This example illustrates using a utility property, TeamState, to obtain the unwrapped `TGrainState` instance.
##### Register the Storage Provider
The above example defines a name for the Storage Provider that will be used for the grain. A Storage Provider with this name must be registered during Silo startup.
##### Implement the Indexed Interface `TProperties` Accessors
As shown above, the grain must implement the property setting in its Task-based property wrappers. As with all Orleans Grains, its methods must be Task-based as part of the remoting system. The grain simply implements an interface method call as a property get or set on its contained `TGrainState` instrance. See the actual code files for the implementation of the SetProperty() private method.

Again, notice that there is no `TProperties` instantiated; the index interface implementations operate on the `TGrainState` instance. The IIndexedState creates ephemeral `TProperties` instances as part of its index-writing operation.
##### Implement Required Overrides of Grain Methods
As shown  above, because indexed Grains no longer inherit from a `Grain` subclass, an indexed Grain must implement overrides of the following methods, which simply redirect to the matching implementation method of the `indexedState`:
- `Grain` methods: `OnActivateAsync()` and `OnDeactivateAsync`. These must add the grain to and remove it from the list of active indexes.
- The grain must also provide a method on one or more interfaces that allows a consumer of that grain to tell it to save its state (and that of any modified index entries). For example, the grain might implement a `SaveAsync()` method. In its simplest form this method is simply a redirector to `IIndexWriter<TGrainState>.WriteAsync()`, and it may do other operations as well.
- Optionally, the grain may provide a method on one or more interfaces that allows a consumer of that grain to tell it to re-read its state from persistent storage. In its simplest form, this method is simply a redirector to `IIndexWriter<TGrainState>.ReadAsync()`, and it may do other operations as well. Because the `IIndexWriter<TGrainState>.State` instance provides the backing storage for the grain's indexed properties, calling `IIndexWriter<TGrainState>.ReadAsync()` discards any non-persisted changes to the indexed properties as well as to the non-indexed state.
##### Implement IIndexableGrain Methods
The `IIndexableGrain` methods `GetActiveWorkflowIdsSet()` and `RemoveFromActiveWorkflowIds()` are necessary for the fault-tolerant internal implementation to communicate back to the grain to retrieve and update the set of in-flight workflows. As shown above, these simply redirect to the matching implementation method of the `indexedState`.
### Querying Indexes
Querying is done by LINQ:
```c#
    var indexFactory = (IIndexFactory)client.ServiceProvider.GetService(typeof(IIndexFactory));

    var query = from team in indexFactory.GetActiveGrains<ISportsTeamGrain, SportsTeamIndexedProperties>()
                 where team.Name == "Seahawks"
                 select team;

    await query.ObserveResults(new QueryResultStreamObserver<ISportsTeamGrain>(async team =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\n\n{await team.GetName()} location = {await team.GetLocation()}, pk = {team.GetPrimaryKeyLong()}");
    }));
```
Orleans.Indexing reads the ExpressionTrees created by LINQ to determine the property that is being requested and translates this into a read operation on the index.

Note that queries fan out to all silos for an index that is partitioned per silo.

#### Partitioning Per-Silo Is Implicitly Fault-Tolerant
For per-silo partitioning, a grain writes its index entries to the same silo it is activated on. Thus, the silo becomes the single unit of failure. This is the only form of workflow-based fault-tolerance currently supported for Active indexes. 
#### Mixing Total and Active Indexes on a Single Grain
It is possible to mix Total and Active indexes on a single grain that uses non-fault-tolerant workflow indexing or transactional indexing. However, it requires some care to avoid potentially unexpected grain activation. Indexed queries return GrainReferences, which does not cause grain activation. However, retrieving a property or calling a method on a grain interface will activate the grain. Retrieving objects by querying a Total index and then enumerating them to retrieve a property will result in activating them all. This can be avoided by considering the Total index to be used for counting only, while an Active index is used for actual operations. For example:
- Create a Total index on Player.Location
- Create an Active index on Player.Game
- Now you can intersect the results of querying these indexes to get Active Halo players in Seattle and call methods on those grains.
- In contrast, if you had looped through the Total index to retrieve player.Location, then all grains would have been activated.
- Variation: create an Active index on another interface, also on Player.Location. Now you can report "How many Total players are in Seattle? How many are currently Active?"
### Testing Indexes
See test\Orleans.Indexing.Tests for the Unit Tests. These are clustered into 3 groups as defined in the following sections.
#### *Player\** Tests
The *Player* series of tests focuses primarily on indexing Player Location (and occasionally Score).
- Interfaces and classes are defined in the [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/Players](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/Players) subdirectory.
- Test runners are defined in the [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Runners/Players](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Runners/Players) subdirectory.

These use a number X for a grouping of tests, with the following form:
- `IPlayerProperties` defines the properties of a player that may be indexed: Location and Score.
- `IPlayerState` defines an additional non-indexed property: Email.
- `IPlayerGrain` defines all properties of a player, expressed in paired async Get/Set properties returning Tasks.
  - For these tests, players have three properties: Location and Score may be indexed, and Email is not indexed.
- `PlayerXProperties : IPlayerProperties` defines the indexed properties of the player.
- `IPlayerXGrain : IPlayerGrain, IIndexableGrain<PlayerXProperties>` defines the interface for the player implementation.
- `PlayerGrain<TState, TProps> : IndexableGrain<TState, TProps>, IPlayerGrain where TState : IPlayerState where TProps : new()` is the base class implementing common functionality for all player grains:
  - TState must be IPlayerState or a subclass
  - TProps must be a class (and should derive from IPlayerProperties)
- `PlayerXGrain : PlayerGrain<PlayerXGrainState, PlayerXProperties>, IPlayerXGrain` defines the implementing class for PlayerX.

#### *MultiIndex\** Tests
The *MultiIndex\** series of tests is separate from the *Player* series. This series of tests focuses on multiple indexes per grain.
- Base State, Property, and Grain interfaces are defined in the [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/MultiIndex](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/MultiIndex) subdirectory.
- Test runners are also defined in the [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Runners/MultiIndex](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Runners/MultiIndex) subdirectory.
  - Each file contains the state, property, interface, and grain implementation definitions, as defined by the file name.
  - [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/ITestIndexProperties.cs](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/ITestIndexProperties.cs) describes the abbreviations used in the file and test names.
    - For example, MultiIndex_AI_EG_Runner defines all interfaces, classes, and tests to implement testing for Eager Active indexes.
  - Testing includes unique and nonunique indexes on string and int. Additional combinations are TBD.

#### *MultiInterface\** Tests
The *MultiInterface\** series of tests focuses on multiple indexed interfaces, each with one or more indexed properties, per grain. The multi-interface capability was introduced along with the Facet implementation. The tests are organized similarly to the *MultiIndex\** series:
- Base State, Property, and Grain interfaces are defined in the [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/MultiInterface](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/MultiInterface) subdirectory.
- Test runners are also defined in the [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Runners/MultiInterface](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Runners/MultiInterface) subdirectory.
  - Each file contains the state, property, interface, and grain implementation definitions, as defined by the file name.
  - [test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/ITestIndexProperties.cs](/test/Orleans.Indexing.Tests/Grains/ITestIndexProperties.cs) describes the abbreviations used in the file and test names (except for those related to property names; MultiInterface uses the properties interface name instead), but MultiInterface does not otherwise use ITestIndexProperties.
    - For example, MultiInterface_AI_EG_Runner defines all interfaces, classes, and tests to implement testing for Eager Active indexes.
  - Testing uses IPersonGrain, IJobGrain, and IEmployeeGrain indexed interfaces on an Employee grain.
#### *SportsTeamIndexing* Sample
The SportsTeamIndexing sample at Samples\2.1\SportsTeamIndexing illustrates creating a simple indexed application, and serves as an example for creating tests outside the Unit Testing framework.

## Orleans Level
This section defines the Indexing implementation within Orleans.Indexing.

### Reading Property Attributes and Creating Indexes
At Silo startup, the Indexing implementation uses reflection on each Grain class in all assemblies in its ApplicationParts. It reads the list of implemented interfaces for the Grain class and for any Indexable interfaces, it creates and validates the indexes defined on the properties of the `TProperties` of the `IIndexableGrain<TProperties>` underlying that `TIIndexableGrain`. (There is also a public API, `IndexValidator.Validate(Assembly assembly)`, to allow indexes to be validated during Unit Tests.) These indexes are cached, and the cache is keyed on `TIIndexableGrain`, with the value being the list of indexes for that interface. The cache also contains a dictionary of grain implementation classes to their indexed interfaces, for efficient retrieval during `IIndexedState` instantiation.
### Orleans Indexing Interfaces
#### <a name="iindexablegrain"></a>`IIndexableGrain<TProperties>`
In both the old inheritance-based system and the new Facet system, this not only marks the interface as being indexable, but it also defines a couple of methods necessary for the internal fault-tolerant indexing to communicate with the grain to manage the set of in-flight workflows. In the inheritance-based system, the indexing-specific subclass of `Grain<TGrainState>` implemented these; in the Facet system, the grain must implement these as simple call-throughs to the `IIndexedState<TGrainState>` implementation, which as the name implies also manages the `TGrainState` instance.
```c#
    // Interface for a grain interface that will "contain" indexed properties (which are the properties of TProperties).
    public interface IIndexableGrain<TProperties> : IGrain where TProperties: new()
    {
    }

    // Non-generic base interface for indexable grains; provides methods that allow the fault-tolerant indexing
    // implementation to call back to the grain to retrieve and update the list of in-flight workflows.
    public interface IIndexableGrain : IGrain
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// This method returns the set of active workflow IDs for a Total Index
        /// </summary>
        Task<Immutable<HashSet<Guid>>> GetActiveWorkflowIdsSet();

        /// <summary>
        /// This method removes a workflow ID from the list of active workflow IDs for a Total Index
        /// </summary>
        Task RemoveFromActiveWorkflowIds(HashSet<Guid> removedWorkflowId);
    }
```
### Orleans Indexing Implementation Classes
Orleans.Indexing has changed from inheritance to containment; rather than inheriting from an intermediate `Grain<TGrainState>` class implementation that overrides `Grain<TGrainState>.WriteStateAsync()` and other Grain functionality, exposing a facet provides the ability to utilize a contained implementation through constructor injection. This allows multiple facets (such as Transactions and Indexing) to be implemented, as well as allowing customized implementations. Because the virtual members of Grain are not available in the facet system, the `Grain.OnActivateAsync()` and `Grain.OnDeactivateAsync()` methods must be overridden to act as simple redirectors to the `IIndexedState<TGrainState>` that is passed to the grain's Indexing facet constructor argument.
#### Inheritance-based (obsolete and removed)
Under the inheritance design, each indexed grain had to inherit from one of these grain classes, which override WriteStateAsync to provide persistence. This approach has been entirely removed, along with the implementation classes listed here; this section remains in order to assist in migration.
##### <a name="indexablegrainnonfaulttolerant"></a>`IndexableGrainNonFaultTolerant<TProperties>`
An application grain inherits from this if its indexes do not have to be fault-tolerant. This is also the base class for `IndexableGrain<TProperties>`.
##### <a name="indexablegrain"></a>`IndexableGrain<TProperties>`
An application grain inherits from this if its indexes must be fault-tolerant. With fault-tolerant indexing, the in-flight workflows and queues are persisted along with the Grain state (the implementation swaps the base State with a wrapper that includes the original base State as well as the set of in-flight workflow IDs and the active queues). When the grain is reactivated (such as if a server crashed during a previous call), the in-flight workflow state is restored with it, and any pending workflows resume executing. 
#### Facet-based
##### Facet Attribute
The attribute determines whether workflow (fault-tolerant or non-fault-tolerant) or transactional indexing is to be used, and specifies any necessary parameters between the two. See [Facet Specification](#facet-specification) above for more information.
##### <a name="iindexedState"></a>`IIndexedState<TGrainState>`
This is the base class for the indexing Facet implementation. One `IIndexedState` parameter must be on at least one constructor of the indexed grain (there is validation to ensure that there is exactly one for any constructor of a grain that implements a `TIIndexableGrain`, and that there is at least one constructor that has such a parameter). 

The implementation of this interface coordinates the writing of all indexed interfaces defined on the grain. It will retrieve the list of indexed interfaces for the grain from caches that are created during assembly load when indexes are read, validated, and created. It uses the IndexRegistry to maintain cached per-grain-class lists of interfaces and their indexes and properties to do the mapping from `TGrainState` to `TProperties`. If `TGrainState` inherits from `TProperties`, then a simple assignment to the `TProperties` instance is possible; otherwise, an ephemeral instance of `TProperties` is created and the `TGrainState`'s properties are mapped to the corresponding `TProperties` properties. If the index is workflow-based, the indexedState includes the grain state update in the workflow appropriately.

Orleans Indexing supplies three interfaces (and their implementation classes) deriving from `IIndexedState`; the workflow implementations contain the implementation moved from the previous inheritance-based approach. An indexed Grain class should store the IIndexedState as a data member assigned from the constructor's facet parameter. The Orleans implementations for the Orleans-provided interfaces are injected at Silo startup time, and an application can define its own as well.

With the exception of the workflow ID set methods on IIndexedGrain, which an indexed Grain implements by simply passing the call along to the matching methods on the IIndexedState, the details of the various IIndexedState implementations are completely opaque to the indexed grain. The indexed grain class specifies the desired implementation on the Facet attribute of the IIndexedState constructor parameter, and the IIndexedState is instantiated with the specified implementation.

```c#
    // The base interface definition for a class that implements the indexing facet of a grain.
    public interface IIndexedState<TGrainState> where TGrainState : new()
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The persistent state of the grain; includes values for indexed and non-indexed properties.
        /// </summary>
        TGrainState State { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// The <see cref="Grain.OnActivateAsync()"/> implementation must call this; in turn, this calls
        /// <paramref name="onGrainActivateFunc"/>, in which the grain implementation does any additional activation logic needed.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="grain">The grain to manage indexes for</param>
        /// <param name="onGrainActivateFunc">If <paramref name="grain"/> implements custom activation logic, it supplies

        Task OnActivateAsync(Grain grain, Func<Task> onGrainActivateFunc);

        /// <summary>
        /// The <see cref="Grain.OnDeactivateAsync()"/> implementation must call this; in turn, this
        /// calls <paramref name="onGrainDeactivateFunc"/>, in which the grain implementation should

        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="onGrainDeactivateFunc">If the grain implements custom deactivation logic, it supplies

        Task OnDeactivateAsync(Func<Task> onGrainDeactivateFunc);

        /// <summary>
        /// Reads current grain state from the storage provider. Erases any updates to indexed and non-indexed properties.

        /// </summary>
        Task WriteAsync();

        /// <summary>
        /// This method removes a workflow ID from the list of active workflow IDs for a fault-tolerant Total Index
        /// </summary>
        Task RemoveFromActiveWorkflowIds(HashSet<Guid> removedWorkflowId);
    }

    public interface INonFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedState<TGrainState> : IIndexedState<TGrainState> where TGrainState : new()
    {
    }

    public interface IFaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedState<TGrainState> : IIndexedState<TGrainState> where TGrainState : new()
    {
    }

    public interface ITransactionalIndexedState<TGrainState> : IIndexedState<TGrainState> where TGrainState : new()
    {
    }
```
### Data Integrity Considerations
As described in [the paper](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p29-bernstein-cidr17.pdf), the Grain state and Index state must remain consistent. Additionally, unique indexes must have zero or one entry.

The [Constraints on Indexing](#constraints-on-indexing) section below describes some limitations on index definitions to prevent some scenarios for which these requirements cannot be guaranteed. This section clarifies some considerations for the supported index definitions and partitioning specifications.

Per-Silo partitioned indexes provide grain and index state consistency automatically. In this scenario, a grain always updates the index on the same silo the grain is activated on, so the unit of failure is the silo itself. Per-Silo indexes are not persisted, because everything remains in RAM and consistent unless the silo goes down. However, other than fanning out for queries, cross-silo consistency is not checked by design, and thus we do not allow Total or Unique indexes to be partitioned Per-Silo.

For Per-Key-Hash indexes, the index may reside on a silo other than the one the grain is activated on. For these indexes, the index state is persisted. For example, if an Active index bucket on one silo contains entries for grains that are spread out on all silos of a cluster, then if the silo containing the index goes down, the index bucket will be reactivated the next time it is referenced by the indexing code (via index operations on grains that map to that bucket). An index bucket is obtained by GetGrain() using an ID that is formed from the interface name, index name, and key hash value. When a crashed index bucket is again referenced by GetGrain on its ID, it will be reactivated and will load its state, which for this example includes all grains that were active at the time it crashed. Those active grains that were on the same silo as the index bucket when it crashed are therefore still available for querying; they will be reactivated when an operation is performed on their GrainReferences.

We ensure data consistency between grain and index state by using a fault-tolerant workflow or by using Transactions.

For Fault-tolerant workflow indexes, we provide "eventual consistency". Fault-tolerant indexes store the IDs of in-flight workflows along with the grain's state. First, we enqueue lazy non-tentative updates to the indexes. Then we tentatively update unique indexes, to "reserve" the unique slots and ensure no duplication. If this does not return an error, then we add the workflow IDs for the lazy updates to the grain's state, persist that state, and exit the IIndexedState's WriteAsync() method. There are a couple subtle aspects to this:
- The IIndexedState.WriteAsync() method is called from a method on one or more of the grain's interfaces, which should not allow Interleaving. When the internal fault-tolerant indexing infrastructure calls back to the grain to obtain the set of in-flight workflow IDs, this call goes through the non-interleaved `IIndexableGrain.GetActiveWorkflowIdsSet()` grain interface method. The Orleans messaging system will not allow the `GetActiveWorkflowIdsSet()` call to be made before the method calling `IIndexWriter.WriteAsync()` completes. Thus, the fault-tolerant indexing system cannot retrieve the set of in-flight workflow IDs from a grain before it has correctly persisted its in-flight workflow set.
- If there is a unique index violation, then the grain will eagerly remove the tentative updates. If the grain crashes between the time the lazy updates are enqueued and the time this removal is done, then when the fault-tolerant infrastructure tries to obtain the workflow IDs from the grain, it will not find them (because the grain state was not persisted with them), so the updates are discarded.
- Similarly, if the tentative unique updates pass but the grain crashes before its state is persisted, or crashes or throws an exception during the storage provider's WriteStateAsync(), then again the fault-tolerant infrastructure will not find the tentative workflow IDs in the grain's list of in-flight IDs, so they will be discarded.

Non-fault-tolerant indexes do not provide the above guarantees. For these indexes, the write operations are essentially parallel executions of the task set {[write indexes], write grain state}, where [write indexes] depends on Eager vs. Lazy; for Eager it is [write to index hash buckets], and for Lazy it is [write to index workflow queues]. Thus, it is possible for inconsistencies to result from failures during these tasks.
### Active vs Total Index Implementations
<!-- Note: don't put the period after "vs." because the generated toc link can't be followed -->
These indexes operate very similarly, and it likely would have been possible to implement the distinction via an IndexAttribute parameter rather than separate classes. However, the current API does enforce the constraint against Total indexes being partitioned per-silo in a straightforward way: there is no way to specify such an index (the TotalIndexType does not include PartitionedPerSilo).

In the code, the main difference is that Active indexes are updated on grain activation (when the grain's entries are added to the index buckets) and deactivation (when the grain's entries are removed from the index buckets). This is not done for a Total index, because when we deactivate a grain, by definition we do not remove its entries from Total indexes--and thus, when we activate a grain, its Total index entries are already present if the grain was previously activated, and if not, then there is no non-default state and thus no index entries should be created. (This correctness is ensured by prohibiting per-silo partitioning of Total indexes.)
## Constraints on Indexing
### Incompatible definitions
Some index definitions are not compatible with certain partitioning specifications or Active vs. Total indexing.
#### Total Indexes Cannot be Partitioned Per-Silo
The indexing paper describes this limitation in detail in section 5.2: Per-Silo (physically partitioned) indexes would have to do fan-out operations to update the status of an index entry on a grain, because the grain may have previously been active on a different silo. The API does not contain definitions that allow such an index to be specified. There appears to be no need to implement this.
#### Unique Indexes Cannot Be Active
An Active Index cannot be defined as unique for the following reason:
1. Suppose there's a unique Active Index over persistent objects.
2. The activation of an initialized object could create a conflict in the Active Index.
   E.g., there's an active player PA with email foo and a non-active persistent player PP with email foo.
3. An attempt to activate PP will cause a violation of the Active Index on email.
   In other words, having a Total unique index prevents the possibility of such a conflict; having an Active unique index does not, because one could activate a Grain, set its email to something already there and persist it (and then deactivate it and activate a new one, etc.). The only use case would be "only one such value can be active at a time", but this would lead to more issues than gain. This implies we should disallow such indexes.
#### Unique Indexes Cannot Be Partitioned Per-Silo
As with Total indexes, Unique Indexes partitioned per Silo (physically) would require fan-out operations to all silos to ensure that the indexed property value is unique. This is currently not implemented.
#### Fault-Tolerant Indexes Cannot Be Eager
Fault-Tolerant Indexes are based on the workflow queues, so they cannot be Eager.
#### Fault-Tolerant Indexes Cannot Be Active
Fault-Tolerant Indexes process index activation and deactivation in the workflow queues. When the fault-tolerant infrastructure processes a workflow, it retrieves the grain's list of active workflow IDs. If the workflow is due to a grain deactivation, then retrieving the active workflow IDs will cause the grain to be reactivated, in effect preventing grain deactivation.
#### Cannot Define Both Eager And Lazy Indexes on a Single Grain
Allowing both Eager and Lazy indexes on a single grain would lead to potential difficulties in ensuring correctness.
### Only One Indexing Consistency Scheme (FT, NFT, TRX) per Grain
Orleans only supports a single indexing consistency scheme per Grain class: fault-tolerant or non-fault-tolerant workflow, or transactional. This is reflected in the presence of only a single `IIndexedState` facet parameter.
### Single Implementation Class per Grain Interface
Because GetGrain() must find only one implementation class for a given grain interface, we cannot support some scenarios such as having the same TIIndexedGrainInterface on multiple Grain implementation classes or hierarchies of `TIIndexableGrain`s.

There is an overload of GetGrain() that allows specifying the prefix of the implementation class. This would allow resolution of a single implementation class, but the capability of passing this through the indexing queries has not yet been added.
### <a name="only-one-index-per-query-"></a>Only One Index per Query (==)
The Orleans query syntax currently allows only a single equivalence condition, e.g.: where team.Name == "Seahawks". Following are some specific scenarios that are not supported, together with workarounds where possible.
#### No Compound Indexes
Orleans currently does not have a syntax on property annotations (or property classes) to support indexes across multiple properties, such as specifying an index on League and then on Name. The SportsTeamIndexing sample illustrates how this can be simulated at the application level by defining a computed property (QualifiedName) on the properties class. Note that the class also exposes static methods to compose the component property strings into a single compound string, and to decompose the compound string into its component parts. This ensures consistency and hides the implementation details from the consumer of the class.
#### <a name="no-conjunctions-"></a>No Conjunctions (&&)
Orleans currently does not support intersecting multiple index-query `GrainReference` result sets, such as: where team.Location == "New York, NY" && team.League == "NFL". The SportsTeamIndexing sample illustrates how this can be done at the application level by intersecting HashSets.
#### <a name="no-disjunctions-"></a>No Disjunctions (||)
Orleans currently does not support unioning multiple index-query `GrainReference` result sets, such as: where team.League == "WNBA" || team.League == "NWSL". The SportsTeamIndexing sample illustrates how this can be done at the application level by unioning the result sets.
#### <a name="no-negations-"></a>No Negations (!=)
Orleans currently does not support returning all Grains that do not match a predicate, such as: where team.League != "MLB". There is no workaround for this.
### <a name="no-range-indexes---etc"></a>No Range Indexes (>, <, etc.)
Orleans currently does not support returning all Grains in a range, such as: where player.Level >= 5. There is no workaround for this.

## Possible Extensions to Current Design Proposal:
### Compound Indexes
As noted above, the application can hack together its own implementation of computed properties to provide indexes on more than one property. This would be much more convenient if supplied by Orleans.Indexing. To do so, Orleans would have to define the syntax of the annotations, provide the encoding on write, process the LINQ expression tree to obtain the requested properties, and determine which of the available indexes to apply.
### <a name="index-conjunctions-"></a>Index Conjunctions (&&)
As noted above, the application can intersect the returned `GrainReference`s from multiple index queries. Again, this would be much more convenient if done in Orleans.Indexing. To do so, Orleans would have to process the LINQ expression tree to obtain the requested properties, issue multiple index lookups, and intersect the results.
### <a name="index-disjunctions-"></a>Index Disjunctions (||)
As noted above, the application can union the returned `GrainReference`s from multiple index queries. Again, this would be much more convenient if done in Orleans.Indexing. To do so, Orleans would have to process the LINQ expression tree to obtain the requested properties, issue multiple index lookups, and union the results.
### Negations and Ranges
These cannot be done using the current hash-based approach.
### Adding Explicit TState-to-TProperties Name Mapping
Currently, if `TGrainState` does not inherit from `TProperties`, Indexing maps them by assuming the same property names. We could add an explicit mapping, either by attributes on `TState` and/or `TProperties`, by passing a Dictionary to IIndexedState.Write(), or by some other mapping specification.
### Unique Indexes Partitioned Per-Silo
As stated above, Unique Indexes partitioned per Silo (physically) would require fan-out operations to all silos to ensure that the indexed property value is unique. It is not clear how useful this would be.
### Fault-Tolerant Active Indexes
The spurious grain reactivation cited above could be handled by omitting grain deactivations from the active workflow IDs, or more generally, by adding a flag to the workflow ID indicating whether it is fault-tolerant. If this is done, it is possible that a grain would enqueue an index-entry removal (pursuant to a grain deactivation), persist its state, and then crash. When the queue is reactivated, perhaps due to a request for the just-deactivated grain, it will process that enqueued index-entry removal. This should not be a problem, because this removal will be done before the index-entry add due to grain activation.

If this is done, there are numerous FT Active tests ifdef'd out by "#if ALLOW_FT_ACTIVE", and one check in the runtime (FaultTolerantWorkflowIndexedState) under "#if !ALLOW_FT_ACTIVE".
